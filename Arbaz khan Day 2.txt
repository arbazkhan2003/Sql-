Day 2 :-

Stored Procedure : A Stored Procedure is a set of SQL commands that you save in the database to do a specific task. Instead of writing the same SQL code again and again, you write it once as a stored procedure and just call it when needed.(A Stored Procedure is a saved collection of SQL statements that can be reused to perform tasks like inserting, updating, or retrieving data.
It helps make database operations faster, more organized, and easier to manage.)

Sql Code :-

create database Stored_Procedure;
use Stored_Procedure;
create table info(ID int, city varchar(100),statee varchar(100), pincode int);

insert into info(ID,city,statee,pincode)values(5,'bhuldhana','maharashtra',423056);


create procedure records
as
select * from info
go;
exec records;

insert procedure :-

CREATE PROCEDURE insert1
    @ID INT,
    @City VARCHAR(100),
    @Statee VARCHAR(100),
    @Pincode INT
AS
BEGIN
    INSERT INTO info (ID, city, statee, pincode)
    VALUES (@ID, @City, @Statee, @Pincode);
END;
EXEC insert1 @ID = 3, @City = 'Sillod', @Statee = 'Maharashtra', @Pincode = 431001;

update procedure :-

CREATE PROCEDURE update1
    @ID INT,
    @City VARCHAR(100),
    @Statee VARCHAR(100),
    @Pincode INT
AS
BEGIN
    UPDATE info
    SET city = @City,
        statee = @Statee,
        pincode = @Pincode
    WHERE ID = @ID;
END;
EXEC update1 @ID = 1, @City = 'Ahmedabad', @Statee = 'Gujarat', @Pincode = 380001;

delete procedure :-

CREATE PROCEDURE delete1
    @ID INT
AS
BEGIN
    DELETE FROM info WHERE ID = @ID;
END;
EXEC delete1 @ID = 5;

search procedure :-

CREATE PROCEDURE search1
    @ID INT
AS
BEGIN
    SELECT * FROM info WHERE ID = @ID;
END;
EXEC search1 @ID = 1;
